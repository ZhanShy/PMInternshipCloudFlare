Cloudflare Internship Application: Product Management
Plan for Cloudflare Workers for Gaming

Main statement:
Cloudflare Workers for Gaming will be highly demanded due the increase in consumption of online games and the need for real-time gaming experience. The following solution is beneficial both for game developers and players. Game developers will not bother with the delivery of the game or latency and security issues. Game players will be able to enjoy real-time game experience on any device even if it is a low-end technology.

Market Analysis:
Gaming industry is getting more and more popular. According to Ilker Koksal, Enterprise Tech, it is believed that gaming industry will reach over $300 billion by 2025. There are various sources of revenues, but the new trend “free-to-play” or online games is getting more attentions during past couple years [1]. Online games allow players to play with everyone from the whole world, save their playing histories, share scores and not depend on their devices.

In order to learn the market, it is important to consider game developers, game players and competitors (cloud computing companies that already implemented their services for gaming). By searching about game developers, we will be able to understand what they need and what are the difficulties they would prefer to overcome in easier ways. By analyzing game players, we will be able to see what they expect from games and how they want these games to be delivered to them. By considering the competitors, we will be able to estimate the market share, the risks of implementing our solution and build the success criteria based on previous experience.

The method of learning the market and its needs includes searching for:
•	The experience of both newcomers and professionals in game development (interviews, blogs, tutorials)
•	The experience of game players (streaming videos, blogs) 
•	Reviews on competitors as well as their statistics on official websites.

Possible product changes and additions:
•	Enhancing the community page, so that users can chat with each other and find teammates if need. It is important since game development is better done in a group or game designers and developers will create teams. The community page might include something like a short questionnaire form that describes the person, his/her skills and needs. 
•	Creating new platform for streaming games online. This is a good opportunity for game players to have a real-time experience as well as not depend on their devices, since Cloudflare has a server that is “closer” to the user and he/she can get video games data at low latency. Also online streaming is good for Cloudflare as there will be more visitors of the website and potential for new users in the future.
•	Giving an opportunity to discuss the game development process. Many games are created in teams. The members need a medium to talk and chat. It would be useful for them to have a video chatting and just a chatting platform.
•	The people who want to test the games also needed before the launch of the game. They can be game players. Not only developers, but also testers can be registered to participate in the community page, so that developers will find people to test their product. The community can become something like a social network for game lovers.
•	Planning tool or a Kanban chart included would be a great bonus for game developers. Game development requires good planning.  If there are more than two people in the team it also important for them to know their future deliverables and tasks. 
•	Adding some features from Game Engines that use Java Script (JS) such as Unity. This suggestion seems a little bit hard to implement, since game development requires lots of managing tools for 2D, 3D graphics, sounds, physics, motion, lightning an etc. But Unity Game Engine is popular among game developers and requires JS or C [2].
•	Adding graphical tools for prototyping. Game Development requires good planning and prototyping. Making game developers first build their prototypes using some ready block of codes and graphical tools like in Visual Studio or 3DMax would be a good bonus for them.
•	Including basic blocks of code as a template that is common for most of the games. For example, authorization, push notification, authentication, storing the scores earned, analyzing player’s behavior and etc. Build in authentication and authorization ensures security for the player. Push notifications are mostly about new updates, level accomplishments and etc. Storing the scores can be done on Cloudflare databases, so that player will have a fast access to his/her game history. Player’s behavior can be analyzed so that he/she will have a suitable opponent or level.

Methods of improving the quality of the offerings before the release:
•	Search for similar solutions that were implemented before
•	Find some game developers that are ready to test 
•	Testing by internal staff
•	Testing by people who volunteer to test
•	Analyzing different Game Engines and take the best features and most suitable and appropriate ones for the Cloudflare Workers platform based on game developers’ reviews

Goals of measuring the success of what you build:
•	Increase in the number of new registered users right after the release and over time
•	The analysis of interaction between game developers, players and testers
•	Increase in the number of how many times new features were used and whether it is increasing or decreasing over time
•	Positive reviews by game developers
•	Increase in the number of games released, tested and deployed
•	Increase in the number of views on tutorials of how to use new features of Cloudflare Workers
•	Increase in the number of viewers of the game streams and over time
•	Increase in the number of official website visitors

Risks that might lead to the failure:
•	Professional game developers have all needed hardware and software in their own studios
•	Newcomer game developers are not skillful enough to understand new tools and features
•	Other online streaming sources are more popular 
•	Professional game developers do not need community of game lovers since they have their own reliable team of designers, testers, developers
•	Game developers that do not create online games might find this solution useless
•	Game developers that already use Game Engines might find this solution also useless
•	Competitors might have dominated the market while new features were implemented
•	Budget constraints. It might be costly to implement the features from Game Engines
•	Scheduling issues. It might take time to implement new features and more competitors might appear.
•	Legal issues. Implementing features from Game Engines might require some permissions or ways to somehow make the features unique for Cloudflare only. This process takes time.
